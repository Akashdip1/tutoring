# 1. Recursion

**Recursion** is the ability for a function _to call itself_ directly or indirectly. A **recursive** function solves a particular problem by calling a copy of itself and solving smaller subproblems of the original problems.

An important aspect of **recursion** is that we should provide a certain case in order to terminate the recursion process.

**Recursion in pseudocode as seen in the _binary search_ pseudocode:**

```c
if no doors
    return false
if number behind middle door
    return true
else if number < middle door
    search left half
else if number > middle door
    search right half
```

We're using the same _search algorithm_ for each half. This seems like a cyclical process that will never end, but we're actually changing the input to the function and dividing the problem in half each time, stopping once there are no doors left.
