# 1. Addresses

When a variable is created in **C**, a **memory address** is assigned to that variable. The address is the location of where the variable is stored on the computer.

To access the address of the variable, the **reference operator (&)** is used.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int age = 30;

    printf("%p\n", &age);
}
```

It will return the **address** in hexadecimal form (0x...) which is just a numbering system with base 16.

# 2. Pointers

**Pointers** store the **memory address** of a variable as its value. To print it, use the `%p` format specifier. **Pointers** give you the ability to manipulate data in the computer's memory which can reduce the code and improve the performance.

They point to a _data type_ of the same type, and is created with the `*` operator.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int age = 30;
    int *pointer = &age;

    // prints out the value of age
    printf("%i\n", age);

    // prints out the memory address of age
    printf("%p\n", &age);

    // prints out the memory address of age with the pointer
    printf("%p\n", pointer);
}
```

In the example above, the pointer variable was used to get the memory address of a variable (used together with the `&` **reference operator**).

There's also the possibility to get the value of the variable the pointer points to with the `*` operator, also known as the **dereference operator**.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int age = 30;
    int *pointer = &age;

    // prints out the memory address of age with the pointer
    printf("%p\n", pointer);

    // prints out the value of age with the pointer
    printf("%p\n", *pointer);
}
```

- When the `*` sign is used in declaration `int* pointer`, it creates a **pointer variable**.
- When not used in declaration, it acts as a **dereference operator**.

## 2.1. Pointer Arithmetic

**Pointer arithmetic** is the process of applying mathematical operation to pointers, using them just like numbers.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int numbers[] = {4, 6, 8, 2, 7, 5, 0};

    printf("%i\n", *numbers);
    printf("%i\n", *(numbers + 1));
    printf("%i\n", *(numbers + 2));
    printf("%i\n", *(numbers + 3));
    printf("%i\n", *(numbers + 4));
    printf("%i\n", *(numbers + 5));
    printf("%i\n", *(numbers + 6));
}
```

We add only **1** to the address of `numbers` instead of **4** (**int**s are 4 bytes in size), since the compiler already knows that the type of each value in `numbers` is 4 bytes. With **+1** we're telling the compiler to move the next value in the array, not the next byte.

Also, `numbers` is an array, but we can use it as a pointers with **\*numbers**.

## 2.2. Compare & Copy

When comparing two integers with the same values, the program works as expected.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int n = 50;
    int m = 50;

    if (n == m)
    {
        printf("Same!\n");
    }
    else
    {
        printf("Different!\n");
    }
}
```

When comparing two strings with the same inputs, the program will print '_Different!_'.

```c
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    char *s = get_string("s: ");
    char *t = get_string("t: ");

    if (s == t)
    {
        printf("Same!\n");
    }
    else
    {
        printf("Different!\n");
    }
}
```

This happens because each **string** is a pointer (char \*) to a different location in memory, where the first character of each string is stored. So even if the characters in the string are the same, this will always print '_Different!_'.

The `get_string()` function has been returning just a **char \***, or a pointer to the first character of a string from the used. Since we called `get string()` twice, we got two different pointers back.

This problem can be solved by using the `strcmp()` function from the `string.h` library, which wll to to each string and compare them character by character.

When trying to copy a string, then capitalize the first letter in the copied one, we see that in both strings the first letter is capitalized.

```c
#include <cs50.h>
#include <ctype.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void)
{
    string s = get_string("s: ");

    string t = s;

    t[0] = toupper(t[0]);

    printf("s: %s\n", s);
    printf("t: %s\n", t);
}
```

Since we set **s** and **t** to the same value, or the same address, they're both pointing to the same character, and so we capitalized the same character in memory.

## 2.3. Arrow Operator

In **C**, the **arrow operator (->)** allows the access to elements inside **Structures** and **Unions**. It is used with a _pointer variable pointing to a structure or union_.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// create the structure
struct car {
    char brand[];
    char color[];
    int year;
};

// create the structure object
struct car* firstCar = NULL;

int main(void)
{
    // assign memory to struct variable
    firstCar = (struct car*)
    malloc(sizeof(struct car));

    // assign value to age variable using the arrow operator
    firstCar->year = 2012;

    // print the assigned value
    printf("%i\n", firstCar->year);
}

```

---

# 3. Memory Allocation

To actually make a copy of a string, and solve the problem above, we have to copy each character in `s` to somewhere else in memory. For that, the function `malloc()` is used to allocate some number of bytes in memory. After we're done with it, we'll use `free()` to mark the memory as usable for something else.
Also, we'll use the `strcpy()` from `string.h` library to copy the string.

```c
#include <cs50.h>
#include <ctype.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void)
{
    char *s = get_string("s: ");

    char *t = malloc(strlen(s) + 1);

    // exit if 't' is equal to NULL, meaning the computer is out of memory and there is not an address to point to
    if (t == NULL)
    {
        return 1;
    }

    strcpy(t, s);

    // check that 't' has a length before capitalizing
    if (strlen(t) > 0)
    {
        t[0] = toupper(t[0]);
    }

    printf("s: %s\n", s);
    printf("t: %s\n", t);

    free(t);
}
```

# 4. Memory Layout

The **data types** that need to be stored for our program are organized into different sections.

![](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/notes/4/memory_layout.png)

- the **machine code** section is the compiled program's binary code. When running the program, the code is loaded into memory.
- the **global variables** declare within the program occupy the next section of memory.
- the **heap** section is an empty area where `malloc()` can get free memory for our program to use.
- the **stack** section is used by **functions** and **local variables** as they are called.

If we call `malloc()` for too much memory, we will have a **heap overflow** since we end up going past our heap.
If we call too many functions without returning from them, we will have a **stack overflow**, where our stack has too much memory allocated as well.

---

# 5. Garbage Values

A **garbage value** occurs when allocating a memory for your variable, but you don't assign a value to it. The memory of the variable may still have a value from the previous program.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void)
{
    int scores[3];

    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
    {
        printf("%i\n", scores[i]);
    }
}
```

In the example above, we declared an array named **scores**, but didn't initialize it with any values. The values in the array are **garbage values**, whatever unknown values that were in memory from whatever program was running on the computer before.

If we try to go to an address that's a **garbage value**, our program is likely to crash from a **segmentation fault**.
