# 1. Debugging

**Bugs** are mistakes in programs that cause them to behave differently than intended.

**Debugging** is the process of finding and fixing those **bugs**.

## 1.1. Print Statement Debugging

- the process in which we tell our application with `printf` or any other similar statements in other languages, to generate output while the program is executing.
- the output generated helps diagnose issues within the program.

## 1.2. Debugger

- is a tool built into **VS Code**, which will walk through the program _step-by-step_.

## 1.3. Rubber Duck Debugging

- the technique where we explain the code to a _rubber duck_ or any other _inanimate_ object.
- by talking through the code out loud, we might realize the mistake.
