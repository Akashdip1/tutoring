# 1. Structures

**Structures** also called **structs** are a way to group several related variables into one place, each variable being known as a _member_ of the **structure**.

Unlike arrays, **structures** can contain different data types(int, float, char, etc).

**Creating a Structure in C using the CS50 Library:**

```c
typedef struct
{
    string name;
    string number;
}
person;
```

**Assigning and accessing values:**

```c
person phonebook[1] = {"David", "+1-949-468-2750"};

printf("%s\n", phonebook[0].name)
printf("%s\n", phonebook[0].number)
```
