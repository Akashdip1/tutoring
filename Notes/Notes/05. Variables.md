# 1. Variables in C

In **C**, **variables** must be a specified **data type** and they need **format specifiers** to be printed.

## 1.1. Basic Data Types

| Data Type | Size         | Description                                        |
| --------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| int       | 2 or 4 bytes | stores whole numbers                               |
| float     | 4 bytes      | stores fractional numbers up to 7 decimal digits   |
| double    | 8 bytes      | stores fractional numbers up to 15 decimal digits  |
| char      | 1 byte       | a single character / letter / number / ASCII value |
| long      | 8 bytes      | stores whole numbers, can go higher than int       |
| bool      | 2 bytes      | stores 'true' or 'false' values                    |

## 1.2. Basic Format Specifiers

| Format Specifier | Data Type |
| ---------------- | --------- |
| %d or %i         | int       |
| %f               | float     |
| %1f              | double    |
| %c               | char      |
| %s               | strings   |

## 1.3. Operators

- **'+'** for addition
- **'-'** for substraction
- **'\*'** for multiplication
- **'/'** for division
- **'%'** for remainder

---

## 1.4. Syntactic Sugar

**C** also supports _syntactic sugar_, or shorthand expressions for the same functionality. We could equivalently say `counter += 1;` to add one to _counter_ before storing it again. We could also just write `counter++` or `counter--`.

# 2. Variables in Python

In **Python**, **variables** don't need a specified **data type** or a **format specifier** to pe printed. A **variable** is created when first assigning a value to it.

## 2.1. Basic Data Types

| Data Type | Size     | Description                     |
|-----------|----------|---------------------------------|
| int       | 28 bytes | stores whole numbers            |
| float     | 24 bytes | stores fractional numbers       |
| bool      | 28 bytes | stores 'True' or 'False' values |
| string    | 49 bytes | +1 byte for each character      |

## 2.2. Other Data Types

Besides the previously mentioned **data types**, Python also has as built-in types:

- _**complex**_ - numeric type that returns a complex number by specifing a real number and an imaginary number.
- _**list**_ - sequence type that stores ordered, changeable, and duplicate items.
- _**tuple**_ - sequence type that stores multiple items that are ordered, unchangeable and duplicate.
- _**set**_ - set type that stores unordered, unchangeable and don't allow duplicates.
- _**dict**_ - mapping type that stores ordered, changeable, and don't allow duplicates. Stores data in key - value pairs.
- _**range**_ - sequence type returns a sequence of numbers.

## 2.3. Syntactic Sugar

Similar to **C**, **Python** also supports _syntactic sugar_, although only the expression `counter += 1`.
