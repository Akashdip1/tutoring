# 1. Data Structures

**Data Structures** are forms of organization of data in **memory** so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently. It is also used for processing, retrieving, and storing data.

There are different **basic** and **advanced** types of **data structures** that are used in almost every program or software system that has been developed.

## 1.1. Classification of Data Structures

**Linear Data Strucutres** are structures where **data elements** are arranged _sequentially_ or _linearly_, and where each **element** is attached to its previous and next adjacent **element**.

**Examples**: arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, etc.

**Non-linear Data Structures** are structures where **data elements** are not placed _sequentially_ or _linearly_. In this type of structure we can't traverse all the elements in a single run only.

**Examples**: trees, graphs.

### 1.1.1. Queues

**Queues** are specific properties, namely **FIFO** or _first in, first out_. You can imagine yourself in a line for a ride at an amusement park. The first person in the line gets to go on the ride first. The last person get to go on the ride last.

**Queues** have specific actions associated with them. An item can be **enqueued**, meaning that item can join the line or queue, or an item can be **dequeued**, meaning it can leave once it reaches the front of the line.

---

### 1.1.2. Stacks

**Stacks** have properties that are different than a **queue**: **LIFO** or _last in, first out_. Just like stacking trays in a cafeteria, a tray that is placed in a stack last is the first to be picked.

### 1.1.3. Linked Lists

**Linked Lists** can store a list of values in **different parts of memory**.

- we have the values `1`, `2` and `3`, each stored in some address memory, like `0x123`, `0x456` and `0x789`.
- this is different than an array since our values are no longer next to one another in memory.
- we can use whatever locations in memory that are free.

When **inserting** a new value to a **linked list**, we allocate enough memory for both the value we want to store and the address next to the value.

- next to value `1`, for example, we also store a pointer, `0x456` to the next value and pointer.
- for the last group, we have the null pointer, `0x0`, since there's no next group.

We can also visualize these addresses as just pointers, since we don't need to know what the addresses actually are.

With a **linked list**, we have the tradeoff of needing to allocate more memory for each value and pointer, in order to spend less time adding values.

The next group of boxes with a value and a pointer are called a **node**, a component of a data structure that encapsulates some information. **Nodes** can be implemented with a struct.

### 1.1.4. Binary Search Tree

**Binary Search Trees** are another **data structure** that can be used to store data more efficiently such that it can be searched and retrieved.

- the value that's in the center becomes the top of the tree. Values that are less than the center are placed to the left and values that are more are placed to the right.
- pointers can be used to point to the correct location of each area of memory such that each of these nodes can be connected.

### 1.1.5. Dictionaries

**Dictionaries** are actual book-form dictionaries that have a word and a definition - a _key_ and a _value_.

---

### 1.1.6. Hash Tables

**Hash Tables** are a combination of both arrays and linked lists. When implemented in code, a **hash table** is an _array of pointers to nodes_.

**Hashing** is the idea of taking a value and being able to output another value that becomes a shortcut to it later. For example, the name _Aaron_ can be hashed as value 1, _Ben_, as 2, and so on for the whole alphabet. While not ideal in terms of design, ultimately, putting all _a_'s in one bucket, illustrates how you can use this concept.

**Hash function** is an algorithm that reduces a larger value to something small and predictable. Generally, this function takes in an item you with to add to your hash table and returns an integer representing the array index in which the item should be placed.

### 1.1.7. Tries

**Tries** are always searchable in _constant time_. One downside of **tries** is that they tent to take up a large amount of **memory**.
