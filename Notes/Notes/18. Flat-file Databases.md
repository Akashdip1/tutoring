# 1. Flat-file Databases

A **flat-file database** is a **database** stored in a file called a _flat file_. Records follow a uniform format, and there are no structures for indexing or recognizing relationship between records. Relationships can be inferred from the data in the **database**, but the format of the **database** doesn't make those relationships explicit.

A flat file can be a **plain text file** (csv, tsv, txt) or a **binary file**.

The **records** in the **database** are separated by delimiters such as _tabs_ or _commas_ and each line holds only one record.
