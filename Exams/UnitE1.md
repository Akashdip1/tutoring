#### 2.
Answer any 4 from the below.(Question 'c' is compulsary)
##### a)
Write a program called `rhombus.c` that recreates the pattern below.

```
E.g. - 1: n = 5;
     #####
    #####
   #####
  #####
 #####   

E.g. - 2: n = 3;
   ###
  ###
 ###
```

The program should input a number for the height of the rhombus.

##### b)
Write a program in `c` called `sumeven.c` that, given a number `N`, outputs the sum of all **even** numbers from 1 to N.

Write a program in `c` called `fibonacci.c` that, given a number `N`, outputs the **Nth** term of the fibonacci sequence.

E.g.

Input : 3
Output : 1

Input : 10
Output : 55

##### d)
Write a program called `infinite.c` that prints "infinite-loop no. <number of given iteration>" infinitely.

E.g. 

infinite-loop no. 1
infinite-loop no. 2
infinite-loop no. 3
...

##### e)
Write a function called `checkleap(N)` in a program called `leapyear.c`, that takes a number 'N' as input and checks if the given number is a leap year or not.
