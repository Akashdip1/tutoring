# Attention!!!
 Save your homeworks in your respective folders. The naming format should be the number of homework combined
with a minus symbol "-" and initial letter of your name and the extention should remain the same as of the
 original file, e.g. HW3-k.c. If multiple homeworks are given make a folder with the name convention mentioned
earlier and within that folder save your homeworks according to the question numbers, e.g. - folder name = HW4
and the solutions should be saved as 1.c, 2.c, 3.c ...
