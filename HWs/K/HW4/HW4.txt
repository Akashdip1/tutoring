Implement a program in C that recreates that pyramid, using hashes (#) for bricks, as in the below:

       #
      ##
     ###
    ####
   #####
  ######
 #######
########

But prompt the user for an int for the pyramid’s actual height, so that the program can also output shorter pyramids like the below:

  #
 ##
